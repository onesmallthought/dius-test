# dius-test

DiUS submission. 

Please check my commit history to see how I evolved the solution. 

A few assumptions were made regarding the 'printing' of the scores, especially around tie-breakers. 

A few simplifications were made, especially around the use of explicit exceptions (I felt it wasn't warranted), and the use of a state-machine pattern to represent a tennis Game, as opposed to a Set having 'many' Games (I felt this was a cleaner design)
